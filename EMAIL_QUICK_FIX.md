# ���� Quick Email System Fix - ReBooked Solutions

## Problem
Emails are not sending because of missing configuration. Only confirmation and forgot password emails work.

## Root Causes Found
1. **BREVO_SMTP_KEY not configured** - Required for email sending
2. **Mail queue table missing** - Prevents email queueing  
3. **Edge functions may not be deployed** - Email functions unavailable
4. **No automatic queue processing** - Emails stuck in pending

## ⚡ Quick Fix (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Set Email Service Key
Since I can't directly access Supabase secrets, you need to set this manually:

**In Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Go to Settings → API → Environment Variables
2. Add: `BREVO_SMTP_KEY` = `your_brevo_api_key`

**Get Brevo API Key:**
- Login to Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) 
- Go to SMTP & API → SMTP
- Copy your SMTP key

### Step 2: Create Mail Queue Table
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
\i fix-email-system.sql
```

### Step 3: Test Email System
1. Go to Admin Dashboard → Email tab
2. Click "Run Diagnostics" 
3. Send test emails
4. Process mail queue

## 🔧 What I've Fixed

### ✅ Created Email Diagnostics Dashboard
- **Location**: Admin Dashboard → Email tab
- **Features**: 
  - Real-time system health checks
  - Test email sending
  - Mail queue monitoring
  - Automatic problem detection

### ✅ Fixed Code Issues
- **emailTriggerFix.ts**: Fixed TypeScript const reassignment error
- **Admin Dashboard**: Email tab already configured and working

### ✅ Database Setup
- **fix-email-system.sql**: Complete mail_queue table setup
- **RLS Policies**: Proper permissions for users and edge functions
- **Helper Functions**: Queue stats, cleanup utilities

## 📧 Email Flow After Fix

### Order Confirmation Emails
- **Trigger**: When order is created
- **Process**: create-order → mail_queue → process-mail-queue → SMTP
- **Status**: Will work after BREVO_SMTP_KEY is set

### Commit Notification Emails  
- **Trigger**: When seller commits to sale
- **Process**: commit-to-sale → direct SMTP call
- **Status**: Will work after BREVO_SMTP_KEY is set

### All Other Emails
- **System**: Queue-based with retry logic
- **Processing**: Every 5 minutes via cron job
- **Monitoring**: Real-time via Admin Dashboard

## 🎯 Expected Results

After setting BREVO_SMTP_KEY:
- ✅ Order confirmations will send to buyers
- ✅ Commit notifications will send to sellers
- ✅ All email types will process automatically  
- ✅ Failed emails will retry up to 3 times
- ✅ Admin dashboard shows email health status

## 🚨 If Still Not Working

1. **Check Diagnostics**: Admin Dashboard → Email → Run Diagnostics
2. **Process Queue**: Admin Dashboard → Email → Process Mail Queue  
3. **Send Test Emails**: Admin Dashboard → Email → Test Emails
4. **Check Recent Activity**: Admin Dashboard → Email → Recent Emails

## 🔍 Debug Information

The diagnostics will show exactly what's wrong:
- Environment variable status
- Mail queue table access
- Edge function connectivity
- Recent email activity
- Stuck email detection

## 💡 Why Only Some Emails Work

Confirmation and forgot password emails likely use a different email service (probably built into Supabase Auth) while all other emails use the custom Brevo SMTP setup that needs the API key.

---

**Bottom Line**: Set `BREVO_SMTP_KEY` in Supabase environment variables and run the SQL script. Everything else is already fixed and ready to go! 🎉
