# Password Reset Flow Fix Summary

## Problem
Users clicking password reset links were being logged in instead of being taken to the reset password form. The password reset flow was broken because:

1. Password reset links authenticate users temporarily to verify the reset token
2. The AuthCallback component had an early authentication check that immediately redirected authenticated users to the homepage
3. Users never reached the reset password form

## Root Cause
In `src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx`, lines 19-26 contained logic that checked if a user was already authenticated and immediately redirected them to the homepage. This prevented the password reset flow from completing because:

- Password reset tokens create a temporary authenticated session
- The early redirect intercepted this flow before the recovery type could be processed
- Users were sent to `/` instead of `/reset-password`

## Solution
Modified the early authentication check in `AuthCallback.tsx` to exempt password reset flows:

```typescript
// Check if user is already authenticated and redirect them
// BUT NOT for password reset flows - they need to reach the reset form
useEffect(() => {
  if (!authLoading && isAuthenticated) {
    // Check if this is a password reset flow by looking at URL parameters
    const type = searchParams.get("type") || new URLSearchParams(window.location.hash.substring(1)).get("type");
    
    if (type === "recovery") {
      console.log("üîê Authenticated user in recovery flow - allowing reset password access");
      return; // Don't redirect, let the password reset flow continue
    }
    
    console.log("üîÑ User already authenticated, redirecting from auth callback");
    toast.success("You are already logged in!");
    navigate("/", { replace: true });
    return;
  }
}, [isAuthenticated, authLoading, navigate, searchParams]);
```

## Files Modified
1. `src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx` - Fixed early redirect logic for password reset flows
2. `src/utils/passwordResetFlowTest.ts` - Added debugging utility for testing the flow

## Flow After Fix
1. User requests password reset ‚Üí email sent with link to `/auth/callback?type=recovery&...`
2. User clicks link ‚Üí AuthCallback processes recovery type
3. AuthCallback detects recovery type and skips early redirect
4. AuthCallback authenticates user and redirects to `/reset-password`
5. ResetPassword page verifies session and shows password reset form
6. User sets new password successfully

## Verification
- Email confirmation flow remains unchanged and working
- Password reset flow now properly redirects to reset form
- Added comprehensive debugging for troubleshooting

## Testing
Use the password reset test utility in browser console:
```javascript
testPasswordResetFlow()
```

This fix ensures password reset links work correctly while preserving the email confirmation functionality.
