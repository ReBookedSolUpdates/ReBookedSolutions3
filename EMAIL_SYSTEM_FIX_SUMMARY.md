# Email System Investigation & Fix Summary

## 🔍 Problem Analysis

The user reported that emails are not being sent, specifically:
1. Personal receipts
2. Emails for seller commits  
3. In-app notifications

## 📊 Investigation Results

### ✅ Working Components
1. **Email Edge Functions**: All edge functions exist and are properly implemented
   - `send-email/index.ts` - Main email sending function using Brevo SMTP
   - `process-mail-queue/index.ts` - Queue processor with retry logic
   - `mail-queue-cron/index.ts` - Cron trigger for queue processing

2. **Email Service**: Frontend service with comprehensive template system
   - `src/services/emailService.ts` - Complete with 14+ email templates
   - Templates for all required email types (receipts, commits, notifications)

3. **Email Queue System**: Proper queue-based email processing
   - Database table structure defined
   - Retry logic with max 3 attempts
   - Status tracking (pending/sent/failed)

### ⚠️ Identified Issues

1. **Missing Environment Variables**
   - `BREVO_SMTP_KEY` may not be configured in Supabase secrets
   - Required for email sending via Brevo SMTP service

2. **Mail Queue Table May Not Exist**
   - Table might not be created in database
   - Would prevent emails from being queued

3. **Cron Job Not Scheduled**
   - No automatic processing of mail queue
   - Emails remain stuck in pending status

4. **Email Functions Not Being Called**
   - Order creation triggers may not be working
   - Commit notification triggers may not be working

  - Test email sending capabilities

## 🔧 Required Actions

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard > Settings > API > Environment Variables
supabase secrets set BREVO_SMTP_KEY="your_brevo_api_key_here"
```

### 2. Create Mail Queue Table
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
\i supabase/functions/_shared/create-mail-queue-table.sql
```

### 3. Deploy Edge Functions
```bash
# Deploy email functions
supabase functions deploy send-email
supabase functions deploy process-mail-queue  
supabase functions deploy mail-queue-cron
```

### 4. Set Up Cron Job
- Schedule `mail-queue-cron` to run every 5 minutes
- Can be done via Supabase Dashboard or external cron service

### 5. Test Email System
1. Access Admin Dashboard
2. Go to "Email" tab
3. Run full diagnostics
4. Send test emails for each type (receipt, commit, notification)
5. Check mail queue processing

## 📧 Email Flow Verification

### Receipt Emails
- **Trigger**: Order creation in `supabase/functions/create-order/index.ts`
- **Template**: Buyer confirmation email with order details
- **Status**: ✅ Code exists, needs environment setup

### Commit Emails  
- **Trigger**: Seller commitment in `supabase/functions/commit-to-sale/index.ts`
- **Template**: Buyer and seller notification emails
- **Status**: ✅ Code exists, needs environment setup

### Notification Emails
- **Trigger**: Various order status changes
- **Template**: System notifications via in-app system
- **Status**: ✅ Code exists, may need mail queue processing

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

After implementing these fixes:

1. **Receipt Emails**: ✅ Buyers receive order confirmations immediately
2. **Commit Emails**: ✅ Sellers receive 48-hour commit notifications
3. **Notification Emails**: ✅ All stakeholders receive status updates
4. **Queue Processing**: ✅ Emails are processed automatically every 5 minutes
5. **Error Monitoring**: ✅ Failed emails are tracked and retried
6. **Admin Visibility**: ✅ Full email system monitoring via dashboard

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Set up BREVO_SMTP_KEY environment variable
2. **Database**: Create mail_queue table using provided SQL
3. **Testing**: Use Email Diagnostics Dashboard to verify setup
4. **Monitoring**: Regular checks via Admin Dashboard Email tab
5. **Maintenance**: Monitor failed emails and retry counts
