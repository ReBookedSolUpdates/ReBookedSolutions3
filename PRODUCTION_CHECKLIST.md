## ⚠️ High Priority Issues

### Security ⚠️
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Update dependencies with security vulnerabilities
  - esbuild <=0.24.2 (moderate severity)
  - path-to-regexp 4.0.0-6.2.2 (high severity)  
  - undici <=5.28.5 (moderate severity)
- [ ] Add Content Security Policy headers
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- [ ] Add CSRF protection for forms

### Testing ❌ 
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: No tests exist - Add test suite
  - [ ] Unit tests for core services
  - [ ] Integration tests for payment flow
  - [ ] E2E tests for critical user journeys
  - [ ] Authentication flow tests

### Performance ⚠️
- [ ] **Bundle size**: 3.3MB is too large
  - [ ] Implement code splitting
  - [ ] Lazy load heavy university data
  - [ ] Tree shake unused dependencies
- [ ] Add service worker for caching
- [ ] Optimize images and assets

## 📊 Current Production Score: **62/100**

### Scoring Breakdown:
- **Security**: 6/10 (vulnerabilities fixed, but deps need updates)
- **Code Quality**: 8/10 (strict TS enabled, good error handling) 
- **Performance**: 4/10 (large bundle, no optimization)
- **Testing**: 0/10 (no tests exist)
- **Documentation**: 9/10 (comprehensive docs added)
- **Configuration**: 9/10 (well configured)

## 🎯 To Reach Production Ready (85+):

### Must Fix (Critical - Blocks Production):
1. **Update all vulnerable dependencies** (`npm audit fix --force`)
2. **Add comprehensive test suite** (minimum 70% coverage)
3. **Implement code splitting** (reduce bundle to <1MB)

### Should Fix (High Priority):
4. Add rate limiting and CSP headers
5. Implement proper accessibility (ARIA, keyboard nav)
6. Add monitoring and error tracking (Sentry)

### Nice to Have (Medium Priority):  
7. Service worker for offline functionality
8. Image optimization pipeline
9. Performance monitoring setup

## 🔒 Security Requirements for Production:

- [ ] All dependencies up to date with no vulnerabilities
- [ ] Content Security Policy implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting on API endpoints  
- [ ] Input validation on all forms
- [ ] Audit logging for sensitive operations
- [ ] Regular security scans in CI/CD

## 🧪 Testing Requirements:

- [ ] Unit tests for business logic (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] E2E tests for critical flows:
  - [ ] User registration/login
  - [ ] Book listing creation
  - [ ] Purchase flow end-to-end
  - [ ] Payment processing
  - [ ] Order management

## 📈 Performance Requirements:

- [ ] Bundle size <1MB gzipped
- [ ] First Contentful Paint <2s
- [ ] Time to Interactive <3s
- [ ] Lighthouse score >90
- [ ] Core Web Vitals passing

**Recommendation**: This application is **NOT ready for production** until critical security vulnerabilities are patched and a test suite is implemented. Address these issues before any live deployment.
